Bókun allows flexible contracts with your sellers on the Marketplace. You can overwrite commissions for each product and ticket type. You can define different commission rates for each product in your contract terms by using the commission group feature.

Steps to defining different commissions for each product are below.

* Define the settings of your new commission group.

  * **Title:** The name of the group. Note, this information will be visible on your Marketplace contracts and in your Marketplace profile.

### 2. How do I add products to the new commission group?[​](#2-how-do-i-add-products-to-the-new-commission-group "Direct link to heading")

* Click **Experiences** > **Experiences overview** in the navigation bar. Then open the product you want to assign to the new commission group.

* Under the **Network** tab on the left side menu, navigate to **Commission group** and select the commission group from the drop-down menu tab.

* Remember to save your changes by clicking **Continue**.

 

### 3. How do I add a different commission group to my contract terms?[​](#3-how-do-i-add-a-different-commission-group-to-my-contract-terms "Direct link to heading")

* Select **Marketplace**, click on the **Contract terms** tab in the side navigation and open the contract term you wish to add the commission group to (or [you can create a new contract term](/docs/marketplace-pro/contract-terms/how-to-update-contract-terms-on-existing-marketplace-contracts#create-or-update-contract-terms).

* On the **Contract terms** page:

  1. go to the **Set experience commission** section
  2. make sure that the toggle for **Advanced experience commission options** is green
  3. Select the commission group you want to link to the contract terms

Each contract term has a default commission value for all products but it is possible for you to manually overwrite commission for each commission group, and ticket type as shown in the screenshot above.

Please note that you can add multiple **Product Commission Groups** to one **Contract Term**. Any product **not** assigned to a Commission Group will be assigned the commission you add to the overall Experiences Product Commission section at the top.
