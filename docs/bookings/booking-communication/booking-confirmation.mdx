Whenever a traveller books your experience, they’ll receive a booking confirmation to confirm key booking details via email.

 

## **What does a booking confirmation look like?**[​](#what-does-a-booking-confirmation-look-like "Direct link to heading")

Your booking confirmation includes everything your customer needs to know about their booking, including:

* **Product specific information**, such as the experience booked and arrival details.

* **Your company information**, including your contact details and website.

* **Booking specific details** such as the amount paid, passenger numbers and booking reference.

## **Can I edit information shown on a booking confirmation?**[​](#can-i-edit-information-shown-on-a-booking-confirmation "Direct link to heading")

Whilst there is no central page to make changes to booking confirmations, you can edit specific elements shown on the invoice. Take a look how this is generated below:

1\) **Your business information** - this includes your company name, logo and high level contact details, such as the website URL and email address. To make changes to your details go to **Settings** > **Company** > **Company profile**

2\) **Experience details** - the experience the traveller has booked, as well as the date and time of the departure. This is automatically populated, based on what the traveller has booked.

3\) **Meeting details** - This is the meeting point and pick up times for that specific departure, as specified in your product set up. To make changes to this, go to **Experiences** > **Experiences overview** > select the experience > **Meeting & Pick-up**

4\) **Contact Details** - These are your Service contact details you set under **Settings** > **Company** > **Contact information**. You'll see the service contact section.

5\) **Payment breakdown** - this is summarised, as it is on the invoice.

6\) **Attachments** - this is the booking invoice and ticket for your departure and can be updated as follows:

* **Tickets**: **Experiences** > **Experiences overview** > select the experience > **Advanced section** > **Tickets** (express setup needs to be deselected)
* **Invoice details**: Go to **Settings** > **Company** > **Tickets**

7\) **Traveller Refund Protection** - this will be visible if the traveller chose to purchase Enhanced refund terms. Not yet offering flexible refund terms? Go to **Settings** > **Product extensions** > **Refunds and cancellations** > **Enhanced refund terms** to get started!

 

## **What about tickets or invoices?**[​](#what-about-tickets-or-invoices "Direct link to heading")

Invoices and tickets (where applicable) are sent to your customer in the same email, but as attachments.

 

## **My customer hasn’t received their booking confirmation**[​](#my-customer-hasnt-received-their-booking-confirmation "Direct link to heading")
