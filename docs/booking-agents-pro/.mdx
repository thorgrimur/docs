This article explains what a booking agent is, and how to use the Agents app.

 

## **What is a Booking Agent?**[​](#what-is-a-booking-agent "Direct link to heading")

Booking agents are resellers, who are external to Bókun and your organization, and have access to your Bókun product inventory, so that they can make bookings on your behalf. Agents sell your products, and you pay them a commission for that sale. Usually, booking agents are people or companies that you currently work with.

Here are information on how you create booking agents: [How to add booking agents to Bókun.](/docs/booking-agents-pro/booking-agents/how-to-add-booking-agents-to-bokun-pro)

 

## **How do I get the Agents App?**[​](#how-do-i-get-the-agents-app "Direct link to heading")

In your Bókun account, click **App Store** in the left-hand side menu. Click the **Agents** app and then click **Install App**. You can find further information on how to manage your Apps is [here](/docs/apps-and-the-bokun-app-store/what-they-are-and-how-to-manage-them).

## **Does the app cost anything?**[​](#does-the-app-cost-anything "Direct link to heading")

The **Agents** App is a separate Bókun App within the App Store. **Bókun PLUS and PREMIUM plans** have the app included in the monthy subscription cost.

**Bókun START plan** users can add the **Agents** App to their subscription for **$99 per month**.

 

## **What are the advantages of using Booking Agents?**[​](#what-are-the-advantages-of-using-booking-agents "Direct link to heading")

Adding Booking Agents can help reduce the extra time it takes to manually add reservations from outside your organization into your reservation system.

For example, if you work with a local travel agency that sells your products, and they call or email you each time to make a reservation, you can add them as Booking Agent in Bókun, so that they can book products themselves without having to contact you.

 

## **How can Booking Agents book my products?**[​](#how-can-booking-agents-book-my-products "Direct link to heading")

* You can [add a Booking Agent as a user](/docs/booking-agents-pro/booking-agents/how-to-add-booking-agents-to-bokun-pro), so they can log in to Bókun and book your products themselves.
* You can [add a Booking Agent to a booking that you created](/docs/bookings/booking-management/how-to-add-referral-partners-agents-to-bookings-you-create-manually-in-bokun) internally, so the booking is registered to the agent.
* You can create a [Booking Area](/docs/booking-agents-pro/booking-areas/how-to-create-booking-agent-areas-pro) for the Booking Agent, so they can book without logging into Bókun. **This feature is included with all our paid plans.**

 

## **What are the payment options for Booking Agents?**[​](#what-are-the-payment-options-for-booking-agents "Direct link to heading")

There are three payment options for booking agents:

### **Allow booking as affiliate (pay online with travelers card, full rate).**[​](#allow-booking-as-affiliate-pay-online-with-travelers-card-full-rate "Direct link to heading")

* The booking agent makes a payment with a credit-card at the time of booking. The booking agent invoices you for the commission.
* Example, booking agent books a product that costs 100 USD. According to their terms, they receive 10% commission. They send you an invoice for 10 USD and you keep the 90 USD.
* Note that you must have a [payment provider](/docs/settings/sales-settings/payment-providers/payment-providers-pro) on file for your internal [bookings channel.](/docs/settings/sales-settings/booking-channels/how-to-create-and-use-booking-channels)

### **Allow booking as reseller (accepts payment on your behalf, full rate). Must have positive balance or overdraft limit.**[​](#allow-booking-as-reseller-accepts-payment-on-your-behalf-full-rate-must-have-positive-balance-or-overdraft-limit "Direct link to heading")

* You invoice the booking agent for the full price minus commission.
* Example, booking agent books a product that costs 100 USD. They don't make a payment at the time of booking, they have an overdraft of 1000 USD. According to their terms, they receive 10% commission. You send them an invoice for 90 USD, the Booking Agent pays you 90 USD and keeps the remaining 10 USD. Their overdraft limit is now 900 USD.
* Note that the Booking Agent must have positive balance or overdraft limit. Agents can only book up to the value specified in their monthly overdraft limit. For example, if their overdraft limit is $1000 and the agent has booked $900 for the month, they won't be able to complete a booking for $200.

### **Allow booking as customer (pay online with card, net rate).**[​](#allow-booking-as-customer-pay-online-with-card-net-rate "Direct link to heading")

* You don't need to invoice them, and they don't need to invoice you.
* Example, booking agent books a product that costs 100 USD. According to their terms, they receive 10% commission. They make a payment at the time of booking for 90 USD.
* Note that you must have a [payment provider](/docs/settings/sales-settings/payment-providers/payment-providers-pro) on file for your internal [bookings channel.](/docs/settings/sales-settings/booking-channels/how-to-create-and-use-booking-channels)

 

## **How do I pay my Booking Agent their commission?**[​](#how-do-i-pay-my-booking-agent-their-commission "Direct link to heading")

To pay an agent their commission, you will have to communicate with them directly and come up with a system to do it outside Bókun. Bokun does not process any types of payments. You can keep track of your agents' sales by using the [Agent Sales Report.](/docs/booking-agents-pro/agent-sales/agent-sales-report-pro)

 

## **Where can I find the Agent Sales Report?**[​](#where-can-i-find-the-agent-sales-report "Direct link to heading")

You can find the Agent Sales Report by selecting **Agents** > **Agent Sales**.

 

## **What is Overdraft Limit?**[​](#what-is-overdraft-limit "Direct link to heading")

Overdraft limit is the cap at which you allow your booking agent to make bookings for until he has to renew his overdraft. For example, if you give an agent a cap of  100.000 USD, he can book up to that amount before he has to pay you to renew his overdraft.

 

## **How Do I Add Overdraft Limit for my Agent?**[​](#how-do-i-add-overdraft-limit-for-my-agent "Direct link to heading")

To add overdraft limit go to **Agents** > **Booking Agents**.

Select the Booking Agent you want to give the overdraft limit to. Make sure the Booking Agents are set as reseller.

Under Overdraft limit, click edit and type the amount you want to add.

## **If I add a booking agent as a user of Bókun to make bookings, what will they be able to see?**[​](#if-i-add-a-booking-agent-as-a-user-of-bókun-to-make-bookings-what-will-they-be-able-to-see "Direct link to heading")

Agents have limited access to Bókun. Booking agents that are users will only have access to the Book: Experiences area, and they will only be able to see their own sales.

Please note, if you are previewing the agents Booking Area and go to the agents admin area to take a look at the bookings, you will see all bookings, not just the agents bookings, because you are logged in as you. If you would be logged in as the agent, you will only see the agents bookings.
