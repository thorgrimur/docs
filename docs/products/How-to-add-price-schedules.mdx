You can create price schedules for your experiences to offer your travellers a variety of prices for summer, winter, holidays and other season.

You simply need to create a price schedule and then add it to the products as per instructions below.

You can create multiple price schedules. The price schedule at the top of the list override the ones below it. For example, if you have a price schedule for winter from 1st of October to 31st of December and then another price schedule for Christmas from 20th of December to the 26th of December, you have to make sure to put the Christmas price schedule at the top of the list.
